abstract = {In recent years, Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) are widely deployed in safety-critical embedded systems. The Cloud-of-Chips (CoC) is a scalable MPSoC architecture comprised of a large number of interconnected Integrated Circuits (IC) and Processing Clusters (PC) destined for critical systems. While many researches have focused on addressing the hardware issues of MPSoCs, the communication over them has not been very well explored. Following the SDN concept, we propose a new protocol in order to secure the communication and efficiently manage the routing within the CoC. The SSPSoC includes a private key derivation phase, a group key agreement (GKA) phase, and a data exchange phase in order to ensure that basic security primitives are preserved and provide secure communication. Furthermore, a network of 1-30 nodes is set in order to validate the proposed protocol and measure the network performance and memory consumption of the proposed protocol.},
